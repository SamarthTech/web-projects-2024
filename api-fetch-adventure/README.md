6. Progress to the next level after completing each challenge

## Technical Details 🔧

### Components

- **Code Editor**: Text area for writing fetch requests
- **API Response Area**: Displays the JSON response from the API
- **Feedback Section**: Shows success/error messages and hints
- **Level Information**: Displays current level and objectives

### API Integration

The application currently uses the JSONPlaceholder API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`) for practice requests. The default endpoint for Level 1 is:
```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1
```
