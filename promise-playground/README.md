# JavaScript Promise Playground 🎮

An interactive web-based learning tool designed to help developers master JavaScript Promises and async/await concepts through hands-on exercises.

## 🎯 Overview

JavaScript Promise Playground is an educational platform that provides a series of progressive challenges focused on asynchronous JavaScript programming. Users can write and test their code in real-time while receiving immediate feedback on their solutions.

## ✨ Features

- Interactive code editor with real-time execution
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Instant feedback on code submissions
- Practice with:
  - Basic Promises
  - async/await syntax
  - Error handling
  - Timing operations

## 🎮 Challenges

### Level 1
Create a basic Promise that resolves after a delay
- Task: Implement a function that resolves with "Success!" after 1 second
- Tests for proper Promise implementation and timing

### Level 2
Work with async/await and random delays
- Task: Create an async function with random delay (up to 3 seconds)
- Tests for proper implementation of async/await and timing logic

### Level 3
Handle Promise rejections and error cases
- Task: Implement error handling in asynchronous operations
- Tests for proper rejection handling and error scenarios

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Start coding in the editor
4. Click "Run Code" to test your solution
5. Progress through all levels to master Promises!

## 📁 Project Structure

- Real-time code validation and feedback

## 🎨 Styling

The application features a clean, modern interface with:
- Responsive layout
- Monospace editor for code clarity
- Clear visual feedback for results
- Soft shadows and rounded corners for visual appeal

## 🔒 Security Features

- Safe code execution using Function constructor
- Isolated scope for user-submitted code
- Error boundary implementation
- Protected core game functionality

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

Users will learn:
- Promise creation and handling
- async/await syntax usage
- Error handling in asynchronous code
- Timing and delay implementation
- Best practices for async JavaScript

## 💡 Tips for Users

1. Start with basic Promise syntax before moving to async/await
2. Pay attention to timing requirements in each challenge
3. Don't forget to handle potential errors
4. Test edge cases in your solutions
5. Review previous solutions for patterns and improvements
